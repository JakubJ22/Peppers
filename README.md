# Own data about my plantation.

2022 is the first year of my plantation. Last winter I saw a photo of a basket, full of chilli peppers that inspired me to grow my own plants.
I bought seeds in January this year. I was studying online at the time, so I was at home, in a small vilage. Thanks to this I had a lot of space to build my farm.
My dad helped me with all of this. At the beggining, I planned to grow it all at home, in pots. 
We sowed the seeds in March, after hat I had to return to Gda≈Ñsk, for the last semester of my studies. My dad took care of the plantation untill my return in July.
When I came back, I saw big foil tunnels with hydration systems. We took care of them during the holidays. Now I live in Warsaw, dad takes care of them.
Distribution and analysis are my part of this business now. 

Dad sent me text data last month, I built tables in Excel and visualized the data in Power BI.
